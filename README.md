<h1>Customer Churn Prediction Project 🚀</h1>

<p>Welcome to my latest project on <strong>Customer Churn Prediction</strong>! This project, deployed using <strong>Streamlit</strong>, leverages both classical machine learning and generative AI to help banks identify customers at risk of churning. With models like <strong>Random Forest</strong>, <strong>XGBoost</strong>, <strong>Support Vector Machines</strong>, and more, this project predicts churn probability and offers actionable insights for customer retention.</p>

<h2>🔍 Key Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple Machine Learning Models:</strong> Predictions are based on an ensemble of models, including <strong>Random Forest</strong>, <strong>K-nearest Neighbors</strong>, and <strong>Gradient Boosting</strong>, to determine the likelihood of customer churn.</li>
  <li><strong>Generative AI Integration:</strong> Utilizing <strong>Llama 3.1</strong> (via <strong>Groq</strong>), the app generates interpretable explanations for predictions, helping banks understand the reasons behind potential churn.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Customer Outreach:</strong> The app also employs <strong>Llama 3.1</strong> to generate personalized email content that banks can send to at-risk customers to encourage retention.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Live Demo</h2>
<p>Imagine being a bank manager with access to a dashboard displaying customer data (such as credit score, balance, etc.). The app predicts churn probability, such as a customer having a 19.1% chance of churning due to limited engagement. It then generates personalized email messages, which banks can use to connect with and retain these at-risk customers.</p>

<h2>🏗️ Project Architecture</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Downloaded a bank customer dataset from Kaggle.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Cleaned and normalized the data, performing feature engineering to improve model accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Trained multiple models, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.</li>
  <li><strong>Web App Development:</strong> Created an interactive web app that displays predictions and generates AI-driven explanations and emails.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🔗 Check It Out</h2>
<p>The project is live on <strong>Streamlit</strong> and hosted via <strong>Hex</strong> for public access. This transparency aims to inspire fellow students and promote innovation in AI-driven solutions. A special thank you to <strong>Faizan Ahmed</strong> for his guiding tutorial on Headstarter.</p>
